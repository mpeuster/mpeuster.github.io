career-profile:
    title: About me
    summary: |
      I am a cloud and network researcher at Paderborn University, Germany. My research focusses on network softwarization
      and in particular on network function virtualization (NFV), software defined networks (SDN), mobile networks and 5G, as well as
      benchmarking and performance prediction of distributed systems. I was involved in several European research and innovation projects,
      such as [SONATA-NFV](https://sonata-nfv.github.io/) and [5GTANGO](https://5gtango.eu/) as well as industry-supported open-source
      projects, such as [OpenSource MANO](https://osm.etsi.org/). I am leading multiple open-source projects such as [Containernet](https://containernet.github.io/) and [SNDZoo](https://sndzoo.github.io/)
      and have more than ten years experience as software developer in various areas.

      In my spare time I love to ride motorbikes and being an active volunteer firefighter.
      I volunteer at the fire department of the city of [Paderborn](https://www.paderborn.de/microsite/feuerwehr/ehrenamt/loeschzuege/Loeschzug-Stadtheide.php) as well as at the fire department of my hometown [Stadt Waldeck](https://www.waldeck-stadt.de/) where
      I also serve as president of the local [fire house's booster club](http://www.feuerwehr-nieder-werbe.de/).
